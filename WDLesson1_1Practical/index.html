    <!-- Challenge 2: Create a heading, h1 for Web Technologies -->
     <h1>Web Technologies</h1>
    <!-- Challenge 3: Create a heading, h3 for HTML -->
    <h3>HTML</h3>
    <!-- Challenge 4: Create a paragraph explaining what is HTML. At least 3 sentences. -->
    <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language[a] for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It defines the content and structure of web content. It is often assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript.</p>

    <p>CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML or XML. It is a fundamental technology for web development, working in conjunction with HTML to define the visual appearance and layout of web pages.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted (or just-in-time compiled) programming language that is a core technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. It is primarily known for enabling interactive and dynamic features on websites, such as animated graphics, interactive maps, and responsive user interfaces.
